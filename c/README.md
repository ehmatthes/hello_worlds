Hello World in C
===

Hello World is four lines of code in C. The first line, `#include <stdio.h>` includes the C header file *stdio.h* into the main program file. This allows our program to write to the terminal window.

The line `int main()` declares that this function is going to return an integer value. The curly brace opens a block, and within that block we use the `printf()` function to display the string "Hello C world!" to the screen. Then we return the value 0, which indicates success.
